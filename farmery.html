                and
                preservative-free milk.
                It's an equivalent of serving fresh whole milk from your own farm while being present in an urban living

                            This
                            is quite unique unlike other brands where milk is 4-5 days old and heavily processed for
                            consistency. We
                            have no middleman, and source directly from co-managed farms. This helps control the
